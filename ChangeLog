==== version 1.1.3 (2023-06-29) ====

* waf: update to 2.0.25
* g2d: Fix typo in G2D allocator that caused build errors
* Don't check for mxcfb.h in build script
  mxcfb.h is no longer present in some sysroots anymore,
  so it is not a reliable way for verifying the imx linux
  headers path. Just use the path directly; if it is wrong,
  the build will fail anyway.

==== version 1.1.2 (2022-05-06) ====

* waf: update to 2.0.23
* dma-heap: Add support for uncached dma-heap memory
  imx_dma_buffer_dma_heap_allocator_new_from_fd() is
  a new function that partially deprecates the dma_heap_fd
  argument of imx_dma_buffer_dma_heap_allocator_new().

==== version 1.1.1 (2022-04-30) ====

* Add sync access functions to ensure cache
  coherency when allocating cached DMA memory;
  only done by dma-heap allocator at this time
* Relax buffer mapping flags checks
* Add API functions to retrieve dma-heap / ION FDs

==== version 1.1.0 (2021-10-29) ====

* Add dma-heap allocator
* Documentation and typo fixes
* Use RW flags in ION allocator if no mapping
  flags are specified
* Add checks for attempts to map already mapped
  buffers with different flags than in the
  original mapping

==== version 1.0.1 (2020-04-09) ====

* Changes to migrate build system to Python 3:
  * waf: update to 2.0.12
  * waf: use python3

==== version 1.0.0 (2019-07-07) ====
